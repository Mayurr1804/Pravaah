# Microplastic Detection & Water Quality Prediction System

An AI-powered system for detecting microplastics, predicting water quality, and simulating environmental impacts using machine learning, deep learning, and physics-informed models.

## Overview

This project provides an end-to-end intelligent framework to:

* Detect and classify microplastics from images
* Identify polymer types using spectroscopic ML models
* Predict and forecast Water Quality Index (WQI)
* Simulate environmental impact using a digital twin
* Support decision-making for researchers and policymakers

The system is deployed as an interactive Streamlit dashboard with role-based access.

## Key Features

### Core Models

* **YOLOv8**
  Microplastic detection and classification (Fragments, Fibers, Pellets)

* **Raman Spectroscopy ML**
  Polymer identification (PET, PE, PP, PS, PVC)

* **Random Forest**
  Water Quality Index prediction with 94% test accuracy

* **Prophet**
  60-day WQI time-series forecasting

* **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)**
  Dissolved oxygen prediction based on physical constraints

* **Digital Twin**
  Environmental impact and scenario simulation


### Advanced Capabilities

* Explainable AI (XAI) dashboard with feature importance
* What-if analysis for policy and environmental scenarios
* Multi-role access (Public, Government, Researcher, Admin)
* Real-time alerts based on threshold violations
* Location-based comparison and benchmarking
* Automated PDF report generation
